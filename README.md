Candidate/Constituent app

Candidates create profiles with:
    • Contact info
    • Bio
    • Platform/issues
Constituents sign up to save favorite candidates, track their events & issues, and vote on issues
	**Constituents remain mostly anonymous without formal 	profiles, but with access to saved candidates/issues/notifications

On landing, constituents should be able to:
    • See candidates in their area
    • See trending issues
    • access notifications
    • see current votings
    • potentially see local new stories
